### This is the repository for the final project for OIM3640-01
### The team members are Nina Radman and Ally Scheman 

# 1. The Big Idea:

The primary idea of our project is to help users plan the perfect date! It is hard to come up with ideas on your own, but our website will help users plan an event to go to and restaurants to eat at in order to plan the best date ever! We will utilize a Yelp API in order to provide users with recommendations and detailed information about different restaurants. The big idea is to create a program designed to streamline the decision-making process for users when selecting what to do. Instead of having to sort through Yelp reviews and make an independent decision on where to eat out, this program will streamline all of that on one site, and provide the user with easy access to all of these things. 

Our investigation encompasses a multitude of topics. The primary one focus is on APIs. Additionally, the topic of web-scraping and data visualization in terms of scheduling is also area of exploration.  

Our minimum viable product (MVP) for the project involves users inputting their location and/or date they are interested in. Subsequently, the program will curate a list of restaurants near the location and some events near a location near a date. For all the indecisive people out there, it will help give the best recommendations based on reviews on which option the user should eat at. Ultimately, we want to develop a Flask-based site, that allows users to enter in their location and cuisine preference and come up with a multitude of results for restaurants. 

In pursuit of a more ambitious objective, our project's stretch goal is generating a cohesive summary of all the features results of restaurants, events, and add movie lookup. This summary aims to distill essential information into a comprehensive schedule offering users a succinct yet informative overview of possibilities for them to consider. 

# 2. Learning Objectives:

Shared: Our collective learning objectives for the restaurant recommendation project involve the mastery of web development techniques using Python, specifically in the context of implementing the Yelp API, Events APi, and movie APi. We aim to develop advanced skills in data visualization through Python to effectively communicate and present the analysis results derived from the restaurant reviews. Ultimately, our shared goal is to engineer a functional and user-friendly product that provides valuable dining recommendations. 

Individual: On an individual level, our learning goals within the scope of this restaurant project include honing problem-solving abilities, anticipating and addressing challenges inherent in the analysis of Yelp reviews and the development of the recommendation algorithm. Additionally, we recognize the importance of refining our time management skills, particularly in the collaborative context of this team project, where efficient coordination is crucial to achieving project milestones and delivering a successful end product. 

# 3. Implementation Plan:

To implement our project plan, we will begin by thoroughly exploring and integrating the Yelp API as our primary data source. This involves gaining a comprehensive understanding of its functionalities and ensuring seamless integration into our web development framework, particularly with Python. 

Simultaneously, optimization component of our project, we will delve into the MatPLot libraries and we will investigate other python libraries to look at optimization of different events. These resources will serve as our foundational tools for extracting meaningful insights from the information available through the APIs. Our plan involves an in-depth exploration of these libraries. 

As the project progresses, we will continuously evaluate the performance of these tools and libraries, making adjustments and refinements as needed. Regular team meetings will be scheduled to discuss any challenges encountered and to collaboratively troubleshoot and optimize our implementation. Additionally, we will keep a log of any issues we face with the APIs. 

In cases where uncertainties arise during the implementation phase, our plan includes a commitment to conducting research and seeking guidance from relevant experts or resources. This iterative approach allows us to adapt to evolving requirements and challenges, ensuring the successful execution of our project plan.

# 5. Collaboration Plan:

For our Minimum Viable Product, which will be the fundamental groundwork of our Python code, we will take on a pair programming approach. This will allow us to both foster a comprehensive understanding of our program’s intricacies, ensuring a cohesive foundation. Subsequently, when we aim to implement the wow factor additions and our stretch goal, we will work on these independently, fostering creativity and and both getting to explore different python additions that we are interested in.  

Upon the completion of these individual explorations, we will reconvene for pair programming sessions dedicated to crafting the Flask site. This joint effort is integral, as we will align our perspectives on the user interface as well as both be able to recognize what may seem intuitive on a website to one may not be necessarily to the other, optimizing the website’s efficiency.  

To facilitate our pair programming sessions, we will establish a structured meeting schedule. These sessions will serve as dedicated time to collaboratively work on the code. These meetings will also allow us to address any disparities in our conceptualizations.  

# 6. Risks and Limitations: 

We believe the most significant threat lies in potential challenges associated with API utilization, particularly if we encounter difficulties in seamlessly integrating the Yelp API and Events API into our project. Furthermore, the prospect of incorporating additional restaurant APIs to augment our dataset introduces a potential vulnerability.   

Another limitation for us could be that the reviews are only partial.  

Moreover, a noteworthy challenge lies in the potential ambiguity or coherence issues within the Markov paragraph generated by our algorithm 

# 7. Additional Course Content:

We think learning more about visualizations that can be created within python would be interesting ex. We would love to learn more about AI as well, and being able to extrapolate and create more information.
